1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
Probably about 2 hours total. About in line with what I had scheduled!
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
No issues with calendar etc so far, my only calendar issues have been addressed with Hanna re: the EOS due times. I do wish I wasn't working while doing this, but I'm glad that I won't be working once mod 1 starts for sure.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I had questions regarding conditionals and linking strings to get a different output, but I intend to ask about that to Hanna during class on monday!
